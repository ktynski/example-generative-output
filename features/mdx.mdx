Holocron supports MDX, a superset of Markdown that allows you to import and use React components within your Markdown documents.

An example of an MDX block is shown below:

<button>
    a jsx button
</button>

## What can you do with MDX?

MDX is useful to create more rich websites from your Markdown documents, for example you can add
- Divide content in numbered steps
- Show links in cards
- Add more interactive components

## Holocron components

Holocron has some components built in (you can see them opening the / command and searching for MDX), these components are prefixed with Holocron, for example:

```jsx
<Holocron.Steps>
## Step 1
This is the first step

## Step 2
This is the second step

## Step 3
This is the third step
</Holocron.Steps>
```

The MDX code above will render the following WYSIWYG block in Holocron:

<Holocron.Steps>
## Step 1
This is the first step

## Step 2
This is the second step

## Step 3
This is the third step
</Holocron.Steps>
