# Real time collaboration

Holocron supports real time collaboration, this means that you can edit documents with other people at the same time.

## How to collaborate

To collaborate with other people simply share the invite link for your document, you can find it clicking the "+" sign on the current document users in the toolbar.

## Sharing read-only access

If you connect Holocron to Github you can share read-only access and let them open a PR to suggest changes to your documents.

This is useful if you want to accept suggestions from external people, for example you can let users edit your public documentation website.
